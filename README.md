# Spiking-Whiskers-A-Spiking-neural-Model-for-tactile-perception

## Introduction

This project aims to make a neuromorphic simulation of a Spiking Neural Network for [whisk-eye robot](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p2.11-TAROS2021paper65.pdf). This network utilizes data obtained from 24 Artificial whiskers housed on head space of Whisk-eye robot. This network is used to produce an ego-centric point based cloud of the environment based on tactile sensory information.

Further different animation related to this project is shown.

The duration for this simulation is 2.2 seconds however all data points are not shown in this animation due to computational limitations.

## Whisker interaction with an object

We also decided top use a sphere which was placed infront of the whisk-eye robot to analyse the nature of the SNN. For this experiment whisk-eye robot was ran for 1.2 seconds. Below is the object and respective point cloud animation:
