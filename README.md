##Aknowledgement

This code takes value from a dataset in matlab format, provided by my supervisor and builts a point cloud It was soley developed by me for the purpose of the dissertation. I would like o thank my Supervisor Dr. Martin Pearson to answer even basic questions and keep me motivated for this project. 

## The snn simulator
This simulator (now i will call it snn simulator because it functions something like them but very basic version) can take any dataset of the format that was described in 2 Readme files also given in the dissertation at appendix.

This project actually has two more files which I could have included but I thought that it would be better to show this code and highlight difference between them so you can also use this file to get same results. However, results may vary. For 500Hz change all dt= 1/1000 to dt=1/10000 and follow the changes suggested in the code itself. For making an impression of the object only change you have to make is in Last section "Point Cloud Animation". to make the process fast i have also suggested not run certain cells. So, please read the comments in cell carefully.
