# Spiking-Whiskers-A-Spiking-neural-Model-for-tactile-perception

## Introduction

This project aims to make a neuromorphic simulation of a Spiking Neural Network for [whisk-eye robot](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p2.11-TAROS2021paper65.pdf). This network utilizes data obtained from 24 Artificial whiskers housed on head space of Whisk-eye robot. This network is used to produce an ego-centric point based cloud of the environment based on tactile sensory information.

Further different animation related to this project is shown.

The duration for this simulation is 2.2 seconds however all data points are not shown in this animation due to computational limitations.
